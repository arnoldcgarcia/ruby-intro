# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hellow, World"


# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7 + 3 * 30 + 32

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 32 + 321

# Strings
puts "Hello"

# Combine strings together
puts "Hellow" + " World"
puts "#{3+2} tacos"

# Variables
a = "Hellow"

# Combine strings and variables
puts a + " World Combined"

# String manipulation
a[0]="G"
puts a
puts a.upcase
puts a.reverse
puts a.swapcase
